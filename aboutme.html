					<b>Early Life:</b><br><br> 
					I was born in Taipei, Taiwan on December 5, 1996 to parents Stephen and Boonsian Radcliff. I lived there for about 2 years, before moving to Canton, Georgia, and eventually to Mission Viejo, California. I've spent most of my life in Mission Viejo. I attended Mission Viejo High School, where I played football and wrestled, played bass in the orchestra, participated in our award winning Virtual Enterprise program, and graduated in 2015 with an International Baccelaureate full diploma.
					<br><br><br>
					<b>College:</b><br><br>
					Having lived in California for much of my life, when it came down to choosing where to go to college, the obvious choice was to go out of state. UGA attracted me with it's state of the art academics and awesome football program, which I had followed for much of my life. At the University of Georgia, I am involved in the Club Rugby team and UGA HEROs. I major in Economics, and am enrolled in the Terry College of Business. In my free time, I like to work out and hang out with friends, with the occasional Netflix Binge. 
					<br><br><br>
					<b>Future Plans:</b><br><br>
					The reason I chose to major in Economics is that I still really have no idea what I want to do in life. My hope is to have a good, business related job (although what branch of business eludes me). I don't hope for much. I just want to marry a regular girl who isn't too ugly or too pretty. Have two children, first a girl, then a boy. Retire after my children are married and successful, and spend the rest of my life playing rugby, until finally dying of old age before my wife.
